This project features an Excel dashboard analyzing hotel booking cancellations using data on booking details and guest demographics. The dataset includes columns such as hotel type (City or Resort), cancellation status, arrival date (year and month), number of adults, children, and babies, guest country, reserved and assigned room types, reservation status, and status update date. Two additional columns, Room_Status ("Desired" or "Un-Desired") and Guest_Type (Couples, Family, Single), were created using conditional logic. Pivot tables were used to analyze cancellations by guest type, month, room status, year, and hotel type. The dashboard includes interactive filters for customizing views, charts, and graphs for visualizing trends, and summary statistics for key insights. Users can navigate the dashboard, use filters to customize views, and review insights to understand and address cancellation factors, thereby improving booking retention and customer satisfaction.
